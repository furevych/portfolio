            <p><strong>This project involved processing and aggregating a complex dataset using Python (matplotlib, pandas), with a focus on visualizing the balance between incomes and significant expenses like housing costs.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Flexible functions were created for cleaning, merging, and normalizing data. These functions make it easy to handle current data and integrate future updates.</strong></p>

            <div class="experience">
                <p><strong>Methodology and Calculations:</strong></p>
                <p>This analysis is based on actual prices and income data from reputable, publicly available datasets. To facilitate comparison, the values were transformed into scores.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Transformation:</strong> Real data for household income, housing costs, medical expenses, gas prices, taxes, and the cost of living (CPI) were taken and rounded. These values were then normalized into score ranges. Expenses were transformed into scores from 1 to 10, while incomes were scored from 1 to 100 to reflect their wider range.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grading System:</strong> The normalized scores provide a simplified comparison of how different states rank in terms of income and costs. Higher scores indicate higher values for that category.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proportional Representation:</strong> Since all values originated from actual dollar amounts, the scores effectively represent relative differences in costs and income across states. Equal grading conditions were applied to all states to ensure consistency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Sources:</strong> All datasets were sourced from reliable, open databases to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="experience">
                <p><strong>Flexible Functions for Data Aggregation and Future Integration:</strong></p>
                <p>The code employs a modular approach for handling multiple datasets, ensuring compatibility for future updates and new data sources. Key functionalities are developed for matching, cleaning, and merging data to facilitate seamless analysis and visualization.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>State Name Matching:</strong> Standardization of state names is achieved through regex, which removes extra spaces and normalizes case. This ensures accurate matching across different datasets, preventing mismatches due to formatting differences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> String values, including percentages and commas, are converted into numeric values, making all expense and income data usable for calculations and visualizations. This process can be applied to future datasets for consistent standardization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Loading and Preprocessing:</strong> Specific columns are loaded from CSV files, preparing the data for further processing. This flexibility allows for easy incorporation of new datasets by specifying the file path and relevant columns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> Multiple datasets are merged based on the 'State' column, using an approach that includes all states even if some data categories are missing. This design ensures the easy addition of future datasets without disrupting the existing code structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Main Processing:</strong> The entire workflow is streamlined to load, clean, and merge datasets, allowing for straightforward updates by simply adding new data sources. The merged data is saved for further analysis, making the system adaptable to ongoing data updates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> The aggregated data is visualized clearly, comparing normalized expenses against income. This function is designed for flexibility, enabling users to visualize any state's data with minimal input, ensuring adaptability for future visualization needs.</li>
